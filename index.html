    <h1>Intersection Observer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        The intersection observer API is used to detect when DOM elements enters
        the viewport and exists the viewport - basically which elements the user
        sees in the browser. This will allow sites to lazy-load images and other
        media, render and remove DOM, detect how far down the user looks on your
        website to analyze how much they see of the website. It can also provide
        infinite scrolling as we may see in a social network feed.
      </p>
      <h3>In other words:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.</li>
        <li>
          Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more
          content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't
          have to flip through pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad
          revenues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based
          on whether or not the user will see the result.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        The intersection observer observes if something is in view by setting an
        intersectionRatio. If the ratio is above 0, the content is in view and
        something can happen.<br /><br />
        Intersection Observers work in two parts: an observer instance attached
        to either a specific node or to the overall viewport and a request to
        this observer to monitor specific children within its descendants. When
        the observer is created, it is also provided with a callback that
        receives one or more intersection entries.
