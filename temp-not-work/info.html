    <h1>Intersection Observer</h1>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Intersection Observers have the goal of providing "a way to asynchronously
      observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor
      element or with a top-level document's viewport." This will allow sites to
      lazy-load images and other media, render and remove DOM on demand as we
      would need for a million-row grid, and provide infinite scrolling as we
      may see in a social network feed.
    </p>
    <h3>What can it be used for?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.</li>
      <li>
        Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content
        is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to
        flip through pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad
        revenues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on
        whether or not the user will see the result.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      Intersection Observers work in two parts: an observer instance attached to
      either a specific node or to the overall viewport and a request to this
      observer to monitor specific children within its descendants. When the
      observer is created, it is also provided with a callback that receives one
      or more intersection entries.
